# Deathrun-Development
Development For the deathrun server
Only to be used, and known by current Developers/veterans.
IF this github is shown to the public (non developers/veterans).. you will loose your developer status, and the server may have risk of being stolen...

**_DO NOT re-upload maps to the MAPS Folder_, use your own developer folder under Developers(USERS) to upload modified versions of the saves that you did**

Also use your own folder to upload anything you think should be used for the server and stuff.
