# Deathrun-Development
Development For the deathrun server
Only to be used, and known by current Developers/veterans.
IF this github is shown to the public (non developers/veterans).. you will loose your developer status, and the server may have risk of being stolen...

DO NOT re-upload maps to the MAPS Folder, use your own developer folder under Developers(USERS) to upload modified versions of the saves that you did

Also use your own folder to upload anything you think should be used for the server and stuff.
